# Tracking app

Python app to track time spent on tasks. One can add what taks it wished to track, and the amount to time spent on each task each day. 
It is meant to be a tracking app for desktop only, to avoid interactig with a phone. 
 
It also allows to plot time spent on each task, to be able to visualize progress and consistance.
